0:10 Instead of adding TextViews to the layout .xml, we can do the same via the Java code.

0:15 Can create a TextView for each item in the ArrayList and add it as a child view in the layout.

0:45 Change Relative layout to LinearLayout with vertical attribute.

0:50 Since going to be adding child views dynamically using Java code, need to give each TextView and id so can reference them.

1:30 First need to find the LinearLayout that we called RootView and store it in a variable,

then can start creating and adding TextViews to this LinearLayout.

Therefore, need to start with findViewById method to find the view with the ID rootView.

This will get a view for us.  But we need to cast it specifically to a LinearLayout data type, so we can
add child views to it.

Store this under variable rootView.

2:10 Next need to create TextViews for the LinearLayout.

TextView requires context as its only input.

2:35 Documentation for the TextView class.

2:40 Scroll down to Public constructors.

3:10 In this case, we have "this" passed in as input for this constructor.

This creates a TextView object stored under the variable name wordView whose data type is TextView.

3:30 To change the text that is set on the screen, we call the setText method on the wordView object.
