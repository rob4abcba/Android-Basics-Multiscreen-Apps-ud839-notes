### Import an Existing Project
We’ve created an initial version of the Miwok app for you to start off with, but don’t worry--there’s still plenty left for you to do. When a professional Android developer is joining a new project, it’s very common for the team to already have an existing app that they’re working on. It’s good practice to learn how to read an existing codebase because, oftentimes, you won’t be creating a brand new app from scratch.

Follow these instructions to import the Miwok project into Android Studio on your computer.

Go to this GitHub project repository link.

Click on the “Download zip” button to download the app code.

Unzip the downloaded file on your computer so that you have a “Miwok” folder.

Open Android Studio.

Choose File > Import Project and select the “Miwok” folder. It may take some time for the project to be imported. If you have any issues, check the Troubleshooting notes below.

Once that app has successfully imported, run the app on your Android device (phone, tablet, or emulator). It should look like this screenshot. Nothing happens when you click on any of the categories. That’s expected.


7.Open the Project tab in Android Studio so you can see the file directory.

8.When you’re ready, move onto the quiz. Let’s take a closer look at the codebase for the app (where codebase means all the files in the app). This will help us understand why the app looks and behaves the way it currently does.

At this point, it’s totally normal if you feel nervous about looking at a new codebase because everything looks so foreign. Now is a good time to practice this skill with some guidance from us.

Quiz to develop your own mental model of the app

Note
Ensure that you have the latest extras (Android Studio library, Google Repository, etc) from the Android SDK Manager installed.We
(RL: As of 2018 November, people no longer install these extras via the Android SDK Manager.  

Ensure that you have all the required SDKs installed from the Android SDK Manager. For this course you will need SDK 15 through SDK 23.

If after importing you run into a gradle not synced issue, it may be because at the time, the Miwok app was built on an older Android SDK version than what currently exists. To resolve, try these steps:

Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
Open Android Studio.
File -> New -> Project from version control - GitHub
Paste a link from your repository of the forked Miwok app, push Clone.
Agree the presented terms. Update everything that's asked
Launch on the device
