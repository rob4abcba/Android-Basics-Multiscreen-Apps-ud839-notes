ArrayAdapter<String> itemsAdapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, words);

- 0:30 Create ArrayAdapter object using the "new" keyword
- 0:35 Storing it in a new variable that we are naming "itemsAdapter", where ArrayAdapter is its data type.
- 0:40 How did we know to pass in these 3 inputs --> (this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, words)  ?
- 0:45 Answer: By checking the documentation for ArrayAdapter by Googling "Android ArrayAdapter" or "ArrayAdapter Android".
- 0:50 Scroll down to a section called Public Constructors
- 1:50 If we create a layout, we call it R.layout.<ourname>
- 1:55 If Android created the layout, they call it android.r.layout.<theirname>, where <theirname> = simple_list_item_1 in this case.
- 2:10 Generics ArrayList<E>, where E is a placeholder for any type.  Could be StringList, IntegerList, AnyObjectList, etc.
- 3:10 ArrayAdapter<T>, where T like E is a type parameter that can be swapped out for a specific data object type.
- 3:20 Specifically T stands for data Type.  In our case, we have an array of data type = String
- 3:40 Our ArrayAdapter specifically takes in Strings Elements, and creates list item views for each of these string elements.
- 3:50 Better to create one type of ArrayAdapter<T>, where T can be StringAdapter class, IntegerAdapter class, or AnyObjetAdapter class.  
- 4:00 In our case, we replace the T with String data type.

ListView listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.list);  
- 4:05 Move on to the 2nd line of the 3 lines.
- 4:10 After we find the view with ID = list, we cast its data type into a ListView data type.
- 4:20 The casting will work if we find a TextView or ImageView.
- 4:30 We store a ListView under the name listView.

listView.setAdapter(itemsAdapter);
- 4:35 
- 4:40 Takes in itemsAdapter as a parameter
- 4:45 Calling a setAdapter method on the ListView object we just defined on the 2nd line above.
- 4:50 If we go to the ListView documentation and search setAdapter, we see that this method takes 1 input parameter.  It requires that it be an object of type ListAdapter.  
- 5:00 In our code we only have an ArrayAdapter, not a ListAdapter.  Let's click on hyperlink ListAdapter to find more information.  
- 5:05 Now in the ListAdapter documentation.  If we scroll down a bit, we see Public Methods.  We see it has two abstract methods.
- 5:10 If we 


ListView listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.list);
