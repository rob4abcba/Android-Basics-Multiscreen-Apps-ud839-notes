0:20 Package name is to uniquely identify our app in the Google Play Store.  Every app in the Google Play Store has a unique package name.  

0:30 The import statement imports Java classes that we didn't write, but can still use in our code.  These files belong to other packages of code in the Android framework, which is written by the Android team.  For example, this line: import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity; says we are importing the AppCompatActivity class from the package named   android.support.v7.app

1:00 Anytime we want to add code from other packages, we need to add the corresponding import statements here.  



1:10 class declaration:   public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

Declares that this file contains the definition of the class called MainActivity, which extends from the superclass called AppCompatActivity, which means MainActivity inherits all the behaviors that AppCompatActivity has, such as showing the window in the device or showing the app bar.



1:30 We can also customize the behavior by overwriting certain methods.  We only modify this class declaration if we want to change the name of the class or change where we are inheriting from.



1:45 Next is the method override.

@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
Here we are overriding the onCreate  method that was originally defined in the AppCompatActivity class.  This  onCreate  method is called by Android when it first creates an instance of a MainActivity.  Here we're providing our own steps for what to do when the app is created.



Lastly, is the setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);  Inside the onCreate  method is a line that creates the setContentView method, and passes in the activity_main layout as an input argument.

We're telling Android to put the UI defined in this layout XML file into this activity screen.  Set content view to be an XML layout resource.
